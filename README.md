#Machine Learning
Sandpit for me to try out stuff I've learned on the Stanford Machine Learning course on Coursera.

 * Linear Regression - uses a cost functions and a na√Øve implementation of gradient descent to work out how to convert temperatures expressed in Centigrade into _freedom units_ (Fahrenheit)

 * Logistic Functions - Sigmoid, Boundary and Cost functions for logistic regression, and logistic neural networks

 * Perceptron - the logistic unit that neural networks are built from. This naive impl is self-training and supports feed_forward.
